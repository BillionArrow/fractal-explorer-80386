# fractal-explorer-80386
A program written in x86 that explores a number of fractals in real-time. 

It features 2 zoom modes, either user-controlled zoom automatic zoom into given coordinates.
Featured fractals are the Mandelbrot set, the Sierpinski triangle and a few others which we will implement later on.



## TODO:
- implement main menu and keyboard input
- allow user to select the fractal to be displayed
- implement user controlled zoom
- implement auto zoom
- optimizations
- ?
