# fractal-explorer-80386
A program written in x86 that explores a number of fractals in real-time. 

It features 2 zoom modes, either user-controlled zoom automatic zoom into given coordinates.
Featured fractals are the Mandelbrot set, the Sierpinski triangle and a few others which we will implement later on.



## TODO:
- OK  implement main menu and keyboard input
- OK  allow user to select the fractal to be displayed
- +/- implement user controlled zoom
- +/- optimizations
- X   implement auto zoom 

- frontend is mostly finished now, all that's left is the actual algorithms for calculating the fractals and displaying them on the screen adequately
